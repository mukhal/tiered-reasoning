# Project for EECS 595

### We will explore the following:

1. Grounding to External Knowledge: Grounding  the  model  to  an  existing  Commonsense Knowledge Base such as ATOMIC (Sap et al., 2019) or ConceptNet (Speer et al.,2017). Use a Graph Attention Networks to perform message passing over a subgraph of relevant entites and then use the node representations for predictions. 


2. Improving   Entity   State   Classification: to implement a classifier based on the Recurrent Entity Network (EntNet) (Henaff et al., 2017). Alternatively, providing the full story context to BERT mayimprove results by providing a richer contex-tual embedding if the EntNet approach fails.
